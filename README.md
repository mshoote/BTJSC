# Capstone - BTJSC
This is a Capstone Project at the University of Nebraska Omaha working with Buildertrend to test Javascript Frameworks.
The project will be testing the frameworks mentioned below for efficiency, documentation, and other possible metrics.
After testing the frameworks a recommendation will be made to our client Buildertrend on the best framework for them to use going forward. Currently they use Knockout JS.
